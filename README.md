This is a TypeScript project with React.js that finds the shortest path between a given source cell and a destination cell in an MxN matrix, where each element can either be false or true. The path can only be created out of a cell if its value is true(traversable) and the method returns the fastest route in an array. It uses a Breadth-first search algorithm which has a time complexity of O(mn). 

This function can be useful in various scenarios such as game development, robotics, navigation, image processing and graph theory.
